## Showcased Categories Theme Component

This theme component allows you to add two "Showcased" topic lists (built from your choice of two different categories) to the top of your forum's home page.

In the theme component settings, you can customize the name of each column, as well as choose which category to pull from, along with the maximum amount of topics from that category you'd like to display.
